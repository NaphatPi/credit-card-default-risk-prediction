# Credit Card Default Risk Prediction

## Objectives

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for the Credit Card Default Prediction project. The main objective is to build predictive models to assess the risk of credit card customers defaulting. The models are designed to fit the following two use cases:

1. Predicting the risk of new customers being default.
2. Predicting the risk of current customers being default in the next month.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients). It contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.
